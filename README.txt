The 20KB restriction killed me and this game. I just couldnt do more. 
I had to remove mobile support in order to squeeze it under 20KB. 
I couldnt also add sound due to the same reason :(

Beside devkit included, I used http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ for more advanced compression.
It was still above 20KB, so I renamed by hand most of methods and selectors and 
finnally squeezed it exactly to 20 480 bytes.
